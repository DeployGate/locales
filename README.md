To create a new localization you need to:

 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Copy the English locale files and rename them with target language code. For example:
  * webfront: copy `*.en.yml` to `*.pt.yml` and `*.en.text.erb` to `*.pt.text.erb`
  * android: copy `values` to `values-pt`
 3. Open the copied files on your text editor and replace them with the new language.
