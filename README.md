 * [webfront](webfront) - Resources for the web service frontend
 * [android](android) - Resources for the Android client application

To create a new localization you need to:

 # Fork the repository.
 # Copy the English locale files and rename them with target language code.
  * For example:
    * webfront: copy `*.en.yml` to `*.pt.yml` and `*.en.text.erb` to `*.pt.text.erb`
    * android: copy `values` to `values-pt`
 # Open the copied files on your text editor and replace them with the new language.
 # Send us a pull request!
